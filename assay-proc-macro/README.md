# assay-proc-macro

This proc-macro is a part of the [`assay`](https://github.com/mgattozzi/assay)
crate. You want to use that crate rather than this one directly if you want
things to work properly.

# MSRV Policy
We do not have a Minimum Supported Rust Version and only track `stable`. Given
this crate uses 2021 edition `rustc` >= 1.56 for now, but that's not always
guaranteed to be the case and later versions might require a greater version
than 1.56.
